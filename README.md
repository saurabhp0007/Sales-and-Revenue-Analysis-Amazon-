### What is data analysis?
> The process of analyzing raw data to find trends and insights can be used to make decisions that benefit anyone. In data analysis, we perform various operations like obtaining raw data, organizing and cleaning it, storing it in an accessible place, modeling, and then analyzing data to extract insights that support decision-making.


### What tools are used in data analysis?
> Data analysts need many tools to gather insights from data. Important tools are listed below.

  * **Power BI** : Power BI provides interactive visualizations with self-service business intelligence capabilities, where end users can create dashboards and reports by themselves, without having to depend on anybody.

       
  * **Microsoft Excel** : Microsoft Excel is a platform that will help you get better insights into your data. Being one of the most popular tools for Data Analytics, Microsoft Excel provides the users with features such as sharing workbooks, working on the latest version for real-time collaboration, and adding data to Excel directly from a photo, and so on.
                      
  * **Python** :  Python is a programming language with a wide range of uses. It has a huge range of resource libraries suited to a variety of different data analytics tasks. For example, the NumPy and pandas libraries are great for streamlining highly computational tasks, as well as supporting general data manipulation. Libraries like Beautiful Soup and Scrapy are used to scrape data from the web, while Matplotlib is excellent for data visualization and reporting.
            
  * **Jupyter Notebook** : Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create interactive documents. These combine live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Jupyter Notebook runs in the browser and supports over 40 languages, including Python and R.
                          
  * **Microsoft PowerPoint** : PowerPoint is computer software created by Microsoft which allows the user to create slides with recordings, narrations, transitions, and other features in order to present information. It is used by the data analyst to present insights gathered from data analysis.
